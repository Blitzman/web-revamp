    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <p>My name is Albert(o) and I am PhD Student (Machine Learning and Computer Vision) at the University of Alicante. I received my Master's Degree (Automation and Robotics) and my Bachelor's Degree (Computer Engineering) from the same institution in June 2016 and June 2016 respectively. My advisors are Jose Garcia-Rodriguez and Sergio Orts-Escolano.</p>

    <p>My main research interests include Machine Learning, 3D Computer Vision, and Parallel Computing on GPUs. Currently, my top line of research is Deep Learning for 3D data. My Master's Thesis was focused on 3D Object Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. My Bachelor's Thesis involved the acceleration of a real-time 3D Object Recognition system on GPUs (NVIDIA Jetson TK1) using CUDA. I am also a computer graphics enthusiast and I love Physics, specially how High Performance Computing can be applied to solve challenging Physics problems.</p>

    <p>During the last year of my Bachelor's Degree, I was awarded a Research Collaboration Grant by the Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte. From September 2014 to June 2015, I worked together with Jose Garcia-Rodriguez and Sergio Orts-Escolano on the acceleration of a 3D object recognition pipeline using CUDA and the Jetson TK1. This research eventually became my Bachelor's Thesis.</p>

    <p>After finishing my Bachelor's Degree, I did an internship at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, Germany, June-August 2015, with Ivo Kabadshow, Andreas Beckmann, and Jiri Kraus (NVIDIA), on the development of a CUDA-accelerated version of the Fast Multipole Method used for molecular dynamics simulation. The internship was funded by the Partnership For Advanced Computing in Europe by means of the Summer of High Performance Computing programme. The results of this internship were presented at the GPU Technology Conference held in San Jose (2016).</p>

    <p>After that, I started my Master's Degree, for which I was awarded another Research Initiation Grant by the University of Alicante. From November 2016 to June 2016, I worked together with Jose Garcia-Rodriguez researching on deep learning for 3D object recognition. This line of research led to my Master's Thesis.</p>

    <p>This interest in deep learning made me apply and achieve an internship at NVIDIA Corporation in Santa Clara. During that summer I worked on various deep learning projects, mainly using Caffe and CNNs, while I was embedded in the Mobile Visual Computing group at NVIDIA Research.</p>

		<p>Once I got back from California, I spent a few months reviewing the state of the art of what would become my Thesis topic: pure 3D scene understanding with deep learning techniques applied to graphs. Then I had the opportunity of another internship at Oculus Research in Redmond where I worked during fall of 2017 with the team led by Richard Newcombe.</p>

    <p>Now I am focused on my PhD studies and making this bio grow! Thanks for the visit, and enjoy your stay!</p>
