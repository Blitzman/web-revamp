  - name: Interactive 3D Object Recognition Pipeline on Mobile GPGPU Computing Platforms using Low-cost RGB-D Sensors
    description: In this work, we propose the implementation of a 3D object recognition system which will be optimized to operate under demanding time constraints. The system must be robust so that objects can be recognized properly in poor light conditions and cluttered scenes with significant levels of occlusion.
